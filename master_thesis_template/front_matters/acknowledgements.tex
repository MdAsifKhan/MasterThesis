The regular discussion and feedback from Prof. Asja gave me a better understanding of the underlying concepts and helped me in developing critical research skills. I am grateful for all the time she spent in reviewing my work and helping me in writing a better version of the thesis. Without her support, this work would never be possible. I also owe a great many thanks to Prof. Dr. Jens Lehmann. His invaluable advice on various occasions and immense knowledge helped me throughout my master studies. He gave me an opportunity to join his research group at Smart Data Analytics (SDA) which incented me to widen my research horizon.
